# GA15_LSTMpred
This model was constructed by deep learning and used amino acid descriptor as the characrization method. This model can predict the self-assembling ablity of hexpeptides.It is helpful to explore the sequence-aggregation relationship of peptides and easy to recognize the assemble-prone sequence in peptides and proteins
